    Praia da Falesia translates to “beach of cliffs” and it is widely believed to be one of the most beautiful beaches in the entire world. With golden sand, clear waters, stunning red cliffs and an abundance of things to do both on the beach and off, you should definitely make this a must-see stop on your Portuguese holiday.
    Located in the Algarve, between Vilamoura and Albufeira, Praia da Falesia is 6 kilometers (km) of sheer perfection. The name translates to Beach of Cliffs and with one look at the bright red cliffs that serve as a backdrop to this sandy oasis, it isn’t hard to see why.
